This is a demo application built using AppRun to mimic a single page business application. It has 8 components:

* Counter: simple counter
* Counters: multiple counters with history
* Drag: a dragable div
* Todo: a component of todo app, with undo and redo
* Type-ahead: use type-ahead to create a selection list
* Benchmark: test performance, executing time logged in console
